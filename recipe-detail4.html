        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h4>
        <p>
          Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine semolina, rice
          flour, all-purpose flour, chopped onions, green chili, ginger,
          cilantro, cumin seeds, whole black peppercorns, and salt. Mix well
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2: Make the Batter</h4>
        <p>
          Add Water: Gradually add water to the dry ingredients while whisking
          continuously to form a smooth, thin batter. The consistency should be
          similar to that of buttermilk. Let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3: Cook the Dosa</h4>
        <p>
          Heat the Pan: Place a non-stick dosa tawa (griddle) on medium-high
          heat. Once hot, sprinkle a few drops of water on the pan and wipe it
          off with a cloth or paper towel to create a slightly damp surface.
          Pour the Batter: Stir the batter well before pouring. Take a ladleful
          of batter and pour it onto the center of the tawa in a circular
          motion, starting from the outer edges and filling in the gaps. Do not
          spread the batter like a regular dosa. Drizzle Oil: Drizzle some
          vegetable oil around the edges and on the surface of the dosa. Cook
          the Dosa: Cook the dosa on medium-high heat until the edges turn
          golden brown and crisp, and the surface is cooked through. No need to
          flip the dosa. Fold and Serve: Fold the dosa into half or roll it up
          and transfer it to a serving plate. Repeat the process with the
          remaining batter.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4: Serve</h4>
        <p>
          Serve Hot: Serve the Rava Dosa hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or
          any chutney of your choice.
