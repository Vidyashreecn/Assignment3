        Hello! I'm Vidyashree C N from Hassan, and I am an engineering graduate
        completed my degree in 2023 with a specialization in Information Science
        Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong
        foundation in various programming languages and technologies, making me
        proficient in HTML, CSS, and Java. I also have hands-on experience with
        API(JDBC), and the Hibernate framework. I am passionate about coding and
        constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set in
        the ever-evolving tech landscape. My enthusiasm for learning new
        technologies drives me to stay updated with the latest industry trends
        and best practices. In addition to my technical skills, I am a problem
        solver at heart and enjoy tackling complex challenges through innovative
        solutions. My academic projects and personal coding endeavors have honed
        my ability to think critically and work efficiently, both independently
        and as part of a team. I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for
        technology in a dynamic and growth-oriented environment, where I can
        contribute to impactful projects and continue my professional
        development.
