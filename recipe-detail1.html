        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Prawns</h4>
        <p>
          Clean and Marinate: Rinse the prawns under cold water and pat them dry
          with paper towels. In a bowl, marinate the prawns with turmeric
          powder, chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and a pinch of
          salt. Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2: Cook the Prawns</h4>
        <p>
          Sauté Onion and Tomatoes: Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over
          medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn
          translucent. Then add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another 2
          minutes. Add Tomatoes and Spices: Add the chopped tomatoes to the
          skillet and cook until they soften and break down. Stir in the
          remaining turmeric powder, chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin
          powder. Cook the spices for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3: Fry the Prawns</h4>
        <p>
          Add the Marinated Prawns: Once the tomatoes are cooked down and the
          spices are fragrant, add the marinated prawns to the skillet. Stir
          well to coat the prawns with the masala mixture.Cook until Done: Cook
          the prawns for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they turn
          pink and are cooked through. Be careful not to overcook them, as they
          can become tough.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4: Garnish and Serve</h4>
        <p>
          Garnish: Once the prawns are cooked, garnish the dish with chopped
          cilantro leaves. Serve: Serve hot with steamed rice or as a side dish
          with roti or naan. Accompany with lemon wedges for a tangy touch.
