        <h3>Hampi</h3>
        <p>
          Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to 1565,
          when it was abandoned.[3] It was a fortified city. Chronicles left by
          Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that
          Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra
          River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets.

        <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
        <p>
          The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars
          in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose
          company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. Locally
          nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was
          constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown
          the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution.
