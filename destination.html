        <div class="box">
          <p>
            The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de
            Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave
            Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to
            1889. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"),
            it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and
            to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution.

        <div class="box">
          <p>
            Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to 1565,
            when it was abandoned.[3] It was a fortified city. Chronicles left

            Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets.
